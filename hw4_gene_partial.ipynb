    "In this exercise, we use logistic regression to predict biological characteristics (\"phenotypes\") from gene expression data. In doing this exercise, you will learn to:\n",
    "* Handle missing data\n",
    "* Perform multi-class logistic classification\n",
    "* Create a confusion matrix (a table of the fraction of samples of class i being confused with class j)\n",
    "* Use L1-regularization for improved estimation in the case of sparse weights \n",
    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Genes are the basic unit in the DNA and encode blueprints for proteins.  When proteins are synthesized from a gene, the gene is said to \"express\".  Micro-arrays are devices that measure the expression levels of large numbers of genes in parallel.  By finding correlations between expression levels and phenotypes, scientists can identify possible genetic markers for biological characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data in this lab comes from:\n",
    "\n",
    "https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Mice+Protein+Expression\n",
    "\n",
    "In this data, mice were characterized by three properties:\n",
    "* Whether they had down's syndrome (trisomy) or not\n",
    "* Whether they were stimulated to learn or not\n",
    "* Whether they had a drug memantine or a saline control solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "With these three choices, there are 8 possible classes for each mouse.  For each mouse, the expression levels were measured across 77 genes.  We will see if the characteristics can be predicted from the gene expression levels.  This classification could reveal which genes are potentially involved in Down's syndrome and if drugs and learning have any noticeable effects.\n"
